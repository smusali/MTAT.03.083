Grable is a digital dining platform designed to enhance the dining experience for its two primary users: restaurants and diners. Every user, whether a restaurant or a diner, must have an authorized account to access the platform. Each restaurant account contains attributes such as name, location, contact details, and a dynamic menu. This menu is a collection of items with attributes like name, ingredients, dietary specifications, category, and price. Restaurants can modify their menu in real time, enabling them to add, disable, or delete items based on availability.

Conversely, diners have attributes like name, contact details, dietary preferences, and payment methods. They can browse through the dynamic menus of various restaurants, view detailed item information, and place orders. An order encapsulates attributes such as a list of selected items, order date and time, table number, and two crucial enumerations: order status (Pending, In-Progress, Completed, Cancelled) and payment status (Unpaid, Paid, Refunded). Diners can add multiple items to their order, but the system ensures that only available items are selectable.

Payment on Grable is a pivotal process. Diners can choose from various payment methods, including Card, Apple Pay, Google Pay, etc. Each payment transaction captures the amount, chosen payment method, and another vital enumeration: transaction status (Successful, Failed, Pending). Grable ensures the secure processing of diner payments, forwarding the amount to the respective restaurant after deducting a predefined commission.

To ensure a smooth flow of information, Grable uses notifications. Both restaurants and diners receive real-time notifications regarding order and payment updates, enhancing the platform's efficiency. These notifications are tailored based on the user type and specific actions or triggers.

Grable is a robust digital interface that seamlessly connects restaurants and diners. It prioritizes real-time information exchange, security, and user-specific customization, ensuring an elevated dining experience for all its users.
